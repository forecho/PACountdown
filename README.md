## Features

- **Automatic 5-Minute Countdown**: Automatically syncs to the 5-minute intervals of the clock (e.g., xx:00, xx:05, xx:10). When launched, it calculates the remaining time in the current interval.
- **Market Hours Awareness**: The timer automatically runs only during US stock market hours (Mon-Fri, 9:30 AM - 4:00 PM ET).
- **Sound Alerts**: Get an audible notification in the final seconds before a 5-minute interval ends.
    - The pre-notification time is adjustable (default: 10 seconds).
    - Sound alerts can be muted/unmuted anytime without stopping the timer.
- **Status Display**:
    - Shows whether the market is currently "Open" or "Closed".
    - Displays the current system time.
